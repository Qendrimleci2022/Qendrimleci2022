I am Qendrim. 

I have worked on many DeFi and Dapps based on Ethereum Blockchain, and I have extensive experience developing and writing Smart Contracts for Ethereum Blockchain.

I have a deep knowledge of blockchain technologies, specifically in constructing the decentralized application, implementing trending methods like yield farming, 
staking, building bridges between networks, etc.

I have worked on multiple coding and business start-up projects related to blockchain and crypto-assets/coins, gaining experience covering blockchain, 
consensus algorithms, ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 tokens, JSON RPC, transactions, coin trading, and decentralized exchanges.

I have also contributed to multiple whitepapers in several completed ICOs.

Here is my set of skills:
• Ethereum tokens & Upgradeable smart contracts
• NFT Creation & Minting
• Cross-chain transactions
• Front-end (website) development
• DAO & P2E gaming
• DeFi & ICO
